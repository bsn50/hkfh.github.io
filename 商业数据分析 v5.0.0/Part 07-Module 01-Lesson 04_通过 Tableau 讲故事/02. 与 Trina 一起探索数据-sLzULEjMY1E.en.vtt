00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.640
So as you were saying before, Tableau
is really good for exploring data.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.820
So I was wondering,

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.370
as a Tableau professional, could you
show us how you explore a data set?

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure, and there are a lot
of different ways to explore data.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.880
But one of the ways that I like to
start is just by asking questions.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.670
And so actually,

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.550
I have a dataset here in-front of me
that shows the top grossing movies.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.415
And we have a number of different
ways that we can explore the data.

00:00:25.415 --> 00:00:29.103
For example we have directors,
genres, the movie title,

00:00:29.103 --> 00:00:31.253
we have the budget and the profit.

00:00:31.253 --> 00:00:37.630
So actually I'm curious about directors
and the profits that they brought in.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.120
So I'm going to take this
dimension of director.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.640
I'm going to drag it here onto my viz.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.400
And then I'm going to find profit and
drag it over here and sort this.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.730
And now I can start to see,

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.490
okay, here are some directors,
then how much money they made.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.670
Now, I'm kind of curious about
Peter Jackson actually, and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.860
so I am going to keep
only Peter Jackson.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.860
So I'm essentially filtering out
all of the other directors and

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.850
I can see that his movies
generated quite a lot of profit.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.860
But which movies are we
talking about here?

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.600
So I'm actually going to take the movie
title and I'm going to drag it here.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.456
And here I can see all the movies
that he made over time.

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:26.070
Now, I'm also interested in
when these movies are made.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.503
So, I have the release date that
I will also drag over here.

00:01:33.503 --> 00:01:37.768
Okay great, so
now we have it sorted from 2001 to 2014.

00:01:37.768 --> 00:01:41.425
Now, I don't really care about
King Kong or The Lovely Bones,

00:01:41.425 --> 00:01:43.979
so we're just going to
exclude those two and

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.050
now we get to compare The Lord
of the Rings versus The Hobbit.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.485
Now which set of movies,
which trilogy, is better?

00:01:52.485 --> 00:01:56.783
And this is a conversation that we have
in the office, right, which is better,

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:58.530
Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit?

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.380
And now we have data to quantitatively
answer this question of which is better.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.430
So we have the profits that
we're looking on here, and

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.229
we can see that the profits of The Lord
of the Rings went up over time and

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.190
the Hobbit profits actually
kind of went down over time.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.030
But how much did it cost to
make these movies anyway?

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.600
We're just looking at how
much they brought in.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.600
Now we also have the budget
that we can look at, so

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.770
let's move the budget over here.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.740
And now in just a minute or so

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.360
I've been able to find out
something really interesting.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.120
Which is that while the budget of Lord
of the Rings went down, the profits kept

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.663
going up and the budget for The Hobbit
was actually quite a lot higher, but

00:02:42.663 --> 00:02:44.733
over time the profits went down.

00:02:44.733 --> 00:02:47.852
So Tableau is a really easy
way to quickly drag and

00:02:47.852 --> 00:02:50.743
drop different elements and
explore data and

00:02:50.743 --> 00:02:55.171
view it in a number of different
ways and start answering questions.

00:02:55.171 --> 00:02:56.880
&gt;&gt; And win bets with your friends.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.780
&gt;&gt; And win bets with your friends,
most importantly.
