00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
Hierarchies in Tableau give you the ability to drill down into your data.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.705
Tableau automatically makes hierarchies for time-based data.

00:00:07.705 --> 00:00:10.050
So let's start with an example using order date.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.900
Create a line chart showing sum of profit by order date.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.070
A line plot is Tableau's default for time data.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.413
There's a little plus symbol on the order date pill now.

00:00:20.413 --> 00:00:22.670
Let's click it and see what happens.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.807
What we've done here is drill down into the hierarchy starting with yearly data,

00:00:26.807 --> 00:00:28.660
then grouping it by quarter.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.405
As you drill down even further,

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:32.820
you can see the data in more granularity.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.284
You will notice the pills have a little minus sign in them now.

00:00:36.284 --> 00:00:38.834
Clicking on it will go back up the hierarchy.

00:00:38.835 --> 00:00:40.740
You can also remove levels of the hierarchy from

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.570
the plot by dragging the pill out of the shelf.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.990
If you drill down to month,

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.245
and remove year and quarter,

00:00:46.244 --> 00:00:48.320
you'll see something like this.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.304
It might not be what you expect here.

00:00:50.304 --> 00:00:53.301
I expect this to show monthly profit over the four years in the data.

00:00:53.301 --> 00:00:56.304
However, there is only one value for each month.

00:00:56.304 --> 00:01:00.314
Tableau is doing this because order date has been set to the discrete data type.

00:01:00.314 --> 00:01:04.034
So it's aggregating the profit values for each month, that is,

00:01:04.034 --> 00:01:09.599
each value is the sum of profit for that month over the four years in the data.

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:13.559
However, I typically like to see this as one long line over all four years.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.278
To change how this is being plotted,

00:01:16.278 --> 00:01:19.710
you need to convert order date to continuous data.

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:22.989
One way you can do this is by going to the field menu,

00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:24.984
clicking on the triangle,

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:27.900
and selecting convert to continuous.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.810
Once you add order date back to the visualization,

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.745
you'll see the plus sign here again.

00:01:32.745 --> 00:01:34.170
If you click it twice,

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.920
you'll get right back down to see the order date by month.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.939
But this time, you'll see it for every month in the dataset.

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.200
Tableau created the hierarchy from

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.019
the date automatically but you can also create your own hierarchies.

00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:51.689
For example, each value in subcategory belongs to one category in the superstore dataset.

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.509
This means that a record with the subcategory value,

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.879
bookcases, always has a category value, furniture.

00:01:57.879 --> 00:02:01.719
However, Tableau doesn't recognize this as a hierarchy.

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:04.319
So we can make a manual one.

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.805
You can do this easily by dragging subcategory onto category.

00:02:08.805 --> 00:02:13.200
Then you can name the hierarchy and I'll name it, products.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:17.569
It shows up on the left and you can drag it in the shelves just like a normal field.

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:23.000
But, now, it starts with category with a plus sign and you can drill down to subcategory.
