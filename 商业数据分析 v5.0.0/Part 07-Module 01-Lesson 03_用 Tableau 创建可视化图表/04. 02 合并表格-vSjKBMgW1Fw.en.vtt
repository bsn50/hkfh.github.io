00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.605
Now, let's take a look at the data.

00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:05.925
To begin, let's join our returns table to the orders table.

00:00:05.924 --> 00:00:08.775
The icon here, indicates that Tableux has

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:12.150
automatically joined these tables as an inner join.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.650
If you click on the icon,

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.440
it will show the other join options.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.435
You could edit the join to be a left join,

00:00:18.434 --> 00:00:21.589
or a right join, or a full outer join.

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:26.629
Right now, let's select left join and close the dialog.

00:00:26.629 --> 00:00:29.445
Now let's click over onto the sheet.

00:00:29.445 --> 00:00:32.759
We now have columns from both orders and returns in our datasource.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.460
And we can see which column headers are showing up under which table.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.859
Here, you see orders and down below you see returns.

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:45.000
Using the fields from a join table is as easy as using any other field.
