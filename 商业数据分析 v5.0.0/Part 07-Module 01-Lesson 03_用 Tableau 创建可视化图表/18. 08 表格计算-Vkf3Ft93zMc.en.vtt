00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.216
Table calculations are performed from the results of a view like

00:00:03.216 --> 00:00:07.259
showing the percent of total sales that comes from a particular region.

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.000
Let's use a table calculation to show the percent of sales that comes from each market.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.515
First, let's plot the sum of profit by market.

00:00:14.515 --> 00:00:16.969
Now, by right clicking on the sum profit,

00:00:16.969 --> 00:00:19.695
you can see add table calculation.

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:23.490
You can manually set the table calculation from this window.

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.779
Or you can use the quick table calculation from the dropdown.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.480
Let's add a quick table calculation to show the percent of total.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.630
When we do so, we can quickly see that APAC represents nearly 30 percent of total sales.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.850
Let's try one more example.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.710
Let's use a table calculation to show quarterly sales growth.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.365
To start, let's create a line plot of sales by

00:00:43.365 --> 00:00:47.219
adding sales to the rows and order date to the columns.

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.829
Now, let's drill down to quarters by clicking this plus sign.

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.969
You can see that this creates four different plots.

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.170
This is because the order date is,

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.940
currently, a discrete variable.

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:59.369
Let's change this by right clicking on order date,

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:01.304
selecting convert to continuous,

00:01:01.304 --> 00:01:08.159
and then re-adding it to the column shelf.

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.500
Now, we're ready to add the table calculation.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.250
Let's right click on sum of sales,

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.959
select quick table calculation,

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:16.629
and click on percent difference.

00:01:16.629 --> 00:01:19.479
Now, we see the percent difference from quarter to quarter.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.055
Perhaps, we want to get even more granular with our line plot by drilling down to week.

00:01:24.055 --> 00:01:28.090
As you can see, the data gets pretty erratic at that level of granularity.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.280
We can use a table calculation to use

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.739
a moving average to make the graph more comprehensible.
