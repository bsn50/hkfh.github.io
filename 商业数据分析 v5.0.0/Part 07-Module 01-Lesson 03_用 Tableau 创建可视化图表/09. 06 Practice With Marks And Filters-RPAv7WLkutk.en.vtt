00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.075
To get some practice with marks and filters,

00:00:03.075 --> 00:00:06.419
let's say your boss asked you to dig into the data to better understand

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:09.740
what regions had the highest profits in 2014.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:16.490
To start, let's drag profit into the row shelf and region into the column shelf.

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:20.279
Now, we need to filter the data to only include 2014.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.810
To do this, let's drag the order date variable into the filters.

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:27.554
There are lots of ways to implement a date filter,

00:00:27.554 --> 00:00:31.589
but in this case, let's select year here and check 2014.

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:33.920
To show the filter,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.920
let's click the dropdown and select show filter.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.965
Lastly, let's sort the columns,

00:00:38.965 --> 00:00:41.063
from highest to lowest of the chart is more readable.

00:00:41.063 --> 00:00:44.580
You could do this with this sort button at the top of the screen.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.439
Now, let's use some additional variables to help us

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:48.824
drill down into the product categories.

00:00:48.825 --> 00:00:50.910
Let's start by bringing in the category field.

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:52.662
You can encode this in a variety of ways,

00:00:52.662 --> 00:00:57.714
but the most logical would be to include it in the rows, like this.

00:00:57.715 --> 00:01:00.645
Make it a separate bar chart for each category,

00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:03.420
or to encode it as color, which we'll do here.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.075
When we encode category as color,

00:01:06.075 --> 00:01:08.370
you can see a legend appears on the right.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.859
We can use this legend to apply filters by clicking on

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:14.519
them and selecting keep only, like this.

00:01:14.519 --> 00:01:17.750
Now, we only see the profit data for furniture.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.534
This adds a category filter to the filter shelf.

00:01:20.534 --> 00:01:21.974
And, if we want to see it,

00:01:21.974 --> 00:01:25.769
we can click the dropdown and select show filter.

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:30.644
Now we're filtered on furniture and let's add subcategory in as color.

00:01:30.644 --> 00:01:35.689
Now, we can see the profit attributable to each product subcategory by region.

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.644
You can add additional detail to the chart by encoding data with the tooltip.

00:01:39.644 --> 00:01:40.852
To finish off this part,

00:01:40.852 --> 00:01:45.179
let's add sales data to the tooltip card so when you hover over each section,

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.000
you can see both the profit and sales.
