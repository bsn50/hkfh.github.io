00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.495
Tableau can connect to many data sources.

00:00:02.495 --> 00:00:04.740
You will notice here in the connect pane,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.669
we have a long list of connections to all sorts of data sources.

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:10.544
Whether it's local files,

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:13.349
databases on premises or in the cloud.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.545
If you're using Tableau public you'll see fewer source options.

00:00:17.545 --> 00:00:20.010
Today we'll be using the global superstore

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.150
Excel file which you can find in the lesson resources.

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:28.049
Superstore is a data set of sales for a global retail chain that sells furniture,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.600
office supplies and technology goods.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.054
Each row of data represents a single item in a transaction.

00:00:34.054 --> 00:00:36.655
To connect to the superstore file and Tableau,

00:00:36.655 --> 00:00:42.429
click on Excel and navigate to where you download the file.

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:44.024
Now you see the data source page.

00:00:44.024 --> 00:00:47.129
On the left you can see all the sheets in the Excel file.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.475
Sheets in Excel are treated the same as tables in the database.

00:00:50.475 --> 00:00:54.195
And we can choose to connect to a single table or join multiple tables.

00:00:54.195 --> 00:00:57.359
Simply drag a sheet onto the canvas.

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.060
Tables can be renamed simply by double clicking on

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.019
the name and we can see the data down here in the grid.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.814
There's a lot we can do on the screen.

00:01:05.814 --> 00:01:09.769
For example, we can rename variables by double clicking on the titles.

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:13.125
We can change the variable types by clicking on this icon here.

00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:16.974
And there's a drop down for more advanced options.

00:01:16.974 --> 00:01:19.589
A workbook can have multiple data sources.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.135
If you click add here you can add another data source as a cross database join.

00:01:24.135 --> 00:01:27.758
If you want to add another data source entirely,

00:01:27.757 --> 00:01:29.799
you can go up here to data.

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.060
New data source. This will allow you to

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.400
access multiple data sources as you're creating your visualizations.
