00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.984
There are two ways to start analyzing data in Tableau.

00:00:02.984 --> 00:00:05.279
You can either jump in and start exploring or you

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.240
can ask questions of your data and attempt to answer them.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.905
We'll start by asking of this dataset, superstore.

00:00:10.904 --> 00:00:12.399
What are our sales like over time?

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.675
If we simply double click sales and order date,

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:17.295
Tableau creates a timeline.

00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:21.060
And we can see our sales are increasing over time.

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:23.414
Note, that the mark type here says, automatic.

00:00:23.414 --> 00:00:26.824
We can change this to be another mark type if we wanted to.

00:00:26.824 --> 00:00:29.369
There's a bunch of mark types available to work with.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.850
One thing to note is, if the mark type is automatic,

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.000
it can change as you make changes to the view.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.424
Let's ask another question.

00:00:37.424 --> 00:00:40.949
What is the relationship between shipping costs and profit?

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.609
This time, we're given what looks like the start of a scatter plot.

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:47.219
However, Tableau's aggregating our data,

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.304
the overall sum of shipping costs and the sum of profit.

00:00:50.304 --> 00:00:51.674
So, we only have one mark.

00:00:51.674 --> 00:00:54.779
We can bring in another field into the view

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.780
to change our breakdown of marks such as category.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.765
If we encode category as color,

00:01:00.765 --> 00:01:03.060
we see one mark for each category.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.775
If we bring in another field like market to shape,

00:01:05.775 --> 00:01:08.900
we get a mark per category per market.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.530
The dimensions we add to the view,

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.894
like category and market,

00:01:11.894 --> 00:01:16.890
define the number of marks that we see or the granularity at which we see the data.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.090
It's easy to change your mind about any variable that we encode.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.409
For example, if we want to change color from category to order priority,

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.569
we simply drag order priority into the color shelf.

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:33.479
Now we see a mark per order priority per market.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.234
If we want to make marks at a certain granularity but without encoding by color or shape,

00:01:38.234 --> 00:01:42.299
we can bring the field to the level of detail shelf.

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.094
It's important to know how adding dimensions to the marks card impacts the visual.

00:01:46.094 --> 00:01:47.894
And, the better you understand this,

00:01:47.894 --> 00:01:51.000
the more precisely you can build data visualizations.
