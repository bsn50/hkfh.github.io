00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
Calculated fields create new fields from the underlying data,

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.090
such as creating a revenue field by multiplying price times quantity.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.540
Let's create a calculated field.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.300
Maybe you want to know the profit,

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.730
per item, for each quarter.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.880
To create a calculated field,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.810
open the menu on a field such as profit.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.860
Then click, create calculated field.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.570
You'll see the editor. On the left,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.580
you can type in the formula you'd like to use to create the field.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.630
And, on the right, you'll see different formulas that you can choose from.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.330
Fields in the editor show up in brackets, like profit.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:40.095
You can do simple arithmetic here by adding a constant or multiplying by field.

00:00:40.095 --> 00:00:42.570
You can also use functions such as absolute value,

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.530
sine, square root, et cetera.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.350
There is a list of functions on the right and

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.530
some short documentation is shown when you select one.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.920
Here, we want to create a new field that calculates the profit,

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.780
per item, for each record.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.560
It's pretty simple, just profit divided by quantity.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.780
You can name the calculated field here and I'll name it, profit per item.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.080
Once you hit OK and create it,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.590
a new field shows up in the data pane.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.855
You can use it like any other field.

00:01:09.855 --> 00:01:15.155
For example, I can make a plot of the average profit per item for each subcategory.

00:01:15.155 --> 00:01:18.390
You can see where profit per item shows up in the data pane.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.605
And next to the number symbol is a little equal sign.

00:01:21.605 --> 00:01:24.690
This indicates that it's a calculated field.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.340
Going back to our original question,

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.085
we wanted to know the average profit per item.

00:01:29.085 --> 00:01:31.910
To change from sum to average,

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.150
we click the dropdown,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.200
go down to measure, change it to average.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:43.380
Here you see that profit for copiers is the highest and is lowest for tables.
