00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.810
We are currently on a sheet.

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.790
Sheets are where we can build visualizations.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.410
Let's go over some of the various areas on the screen.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.775
At the top, we have the menus.

00:00:09.775 --> 00:00:12.150
The menus contain a lot of powerful options and I

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.719
recommend clicking through to see what options they have.

00:00:14.718 --> 00:00:15.809
The logo button, here,

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.240
brings us back to the start experience where we can access

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:20.969
saved data sources recently opened or pinned workbooks.

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:24.629
To the left of the screen is the data pane.

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:26.039
If we're on the data tab,

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.570
the top lists all open data sources.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.475
And, depending on which one is selected,

00:00:30.475 --> 00:00:32.655
the fields from that data source are listed below

00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:35.609
broken out into dimensions and measures.

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:40.049
The data pane will also show any sets or parameters we have.

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:43.259
If we open the maps layer or the format pane,

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:46.219
these temporarily cover the data pane.

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.750
If you click on the analytics tab,

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.280
we can bring out pieces of our analysis directly as drag and drop elements.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.925
If they're not relevant to the type of view,

00:00:54.924 --> 00:00:58.059
certain elements will be grayed out such as totals on a timeline.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.240
If we select something like a trend line,

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.250
we can bring it to any of these dropdown areas to control aspects of its properties,

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.650
like model type or which measure it should be applied to.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.905
New sheets are found down here at the bottom.

00:01:10.905 --> 00:01:12.284
We can create sheets,

00:01:12.284 --> 00:01:15.694
dashboards, or stories with these tabs.

00:01:15.694 --> 00:01:17.159
We can do things like rename sheets,

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.789
duplicate sheets, copy formatting, many other things.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.355
Finally, and perhaps more importantly, we have the shelves.

00:01:23.355 --> 00:01:25.950
Use can be built by dragging and dropping fields from

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.740
the data pane into the canvas directly or onto the shelves.

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:34.159
The shelves are sometimes referred to as cards.

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.920
There's the column shelf and the row shelf up here,

00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:40.215
the pages and filter shelves, and the marks cards.

00:01:40.215 --> 00:01:43.320
The marks card is made up of several other shells.

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:45.989
Each of which can have fields placed on

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:48.689
them and can be clicked on to edit their characteristics.

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.509
Change in the marks type can change the shelves

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.710
on the marks cards such as selecting shape brings up the shape shelf.

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:58.194
Depending on the composition of the view,

00:01:58.194 --> 00:02:01.019
there can be multiple marks cards, one for each measure.

00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:04.319
Legends such as color, size,

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.280
and shape will automatically be created when a field is placed on the color,

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.990
size, or shape shelf.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.445
However, legends can be removed by clicking on the menu and selecting hide card.

00:02:14.444 --> 00:02:15.977
To bring the legend back,

00:02:15.977 --> 00:02:18.473
right click anywhere off the canvas itself,

00:02:18.473 --> 00:02:21.000
select legend and choose the one you want.
