00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.800
Overall, I would say that these colors distract from the data.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.150
The colors shown don't appear to be chosen for any particular reason.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.510
In fact, they're actually the default rainbow colors for the ggplot2 package for

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.721
the R programming language.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.590
These colors are also quite bright, which strains the eyes, and above all,

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.550
each color doesn't actually convey any additional information about the data.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.490
The labels on the left side of the bar plot are enough to

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.700
indicate which bar belongs to which type of diamond cut.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.900
This actually makes the use of color redundant since both the labels and

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.490
the color are indicating the cut type.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.310
You also might have thought that the legend at the right here is unnecessary.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.650
We could simply design this visualization with the labels at the left in

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.930
the graph, decreasing the time for

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.220
the reader's eye to bounce between the legend and the main data display.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.060
Now, I know this is a small display, but this makes sense for

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.960
larger visualizations where the eye would be scanning across an entire page.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.370
So, when it comes to color, what should you do?
