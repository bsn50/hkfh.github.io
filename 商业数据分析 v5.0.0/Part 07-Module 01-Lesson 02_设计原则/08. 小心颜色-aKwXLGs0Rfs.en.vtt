00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.355
Another design component that can

00:00:02.355 --> 00:00:05.440
aid you in your work when creating visualizations is color.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.490
This bar chart displays the count of certain cuts of diamonds,

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.115
and it was made using the R programming language.

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:15.280
I'd like you to take a few minutes to think about how color is used in this chart.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.800
Do the colors add to the visualization?

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.450
Or do they distract from the visualization?

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.875
Come up with a few reasons for yourself.

00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:27.210
Once you're ready, check this box and submit the answer to continue.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.150
Keep in mind that you don't need to submit an answer here.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.720
I just want you to think about this question for a minute.
